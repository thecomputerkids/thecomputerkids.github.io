									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p> My name is Chelsea and I created The Computer Kids because I am passionate about getting young people excited about technology. Specifically, my goal for the children I interact with is to spark an interest in computer coding and a love for being a creative innovator. To learn more about me and check out my past history working with children and code, take a look at my social links below. </p>

									<h2>Why Teach Code?</h2>
									<p>
									 <ol type="1">
	              <li> <strong> Code is one of the world's most widely used languages</strong> </li>
								  Computer science is the new language of the world, and it’s also one of the fastest growing occupations. While it would be foolish to assume that we know exactly what the jobs of the future will be, we do know that 42 per cent of the Canadian labour force is at high risk of being affected by automation.
									<li><strong> Connected devices are already reshaping our world </strong></li>
								Kids also need to learn how to code because computers and connected devices are what will shape their world as they grow up, just as physics, Math, Chemistry and Biology shape our world right now. In about twenty years, an inability to code or at least to understand logic-based thinking to some level will be just as crippling as illiteracy and innumeracy is today.
	              <li><strong> Kids learn better and faster when they're young</strong></li>
								Teaching your child how to code when they are still young is important, because kids have an easier time learning skills than adults do – their minds are flexible and open, and learning code is like learning a language, far easier when you are young.
                <li><strong> Coding is creativity unleashed</strong></li>
								Just like art and craft is a way to express creativity, coding can be a highly engaging, fun and empowering skill for kids today. Platforms like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/Scratch"> Scratch </a>, teach kids how to code in a way that doesn’t make them feel like they are stuck in a classroom learning something they don’t want to. They start out by playing games, and if the child doesn’t like a particular aspect of the game, they can modify it to their preference by rewriting the code.
								<li><strong> Problem solving and critical thought</strong></li>
								 Coding techniques also helps children to develop critical thinking skills and problem solving processes that are not only important in computer science, but also in life. It teaches them how to look at the bigger picture, and to break down big challenges into smaller and more manageable tasks.
